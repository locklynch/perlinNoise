# perlinNoise
supposedly simple graph with perlin noise used to color in cells


I am a dumb :-)

The eventual goal is to use perlin noise to generate a smooth distribution of some kind of element for each cell of a graph.

Right now I'm just trying to draw a graph, and shade said graph with variying shades of white with a perlin noise function

I drew a graph, then creaaashed it trying to impliment the simplex_noise library

halp

okay but really, that's the next step, trying to figure out why that went wrong

current errors to address are as follows

1.  Uncaught ReferenceError: SimplexNoise is not defined
    at perlinNoise.js:15:17
    
2.  index.html:34     GET https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simplex-noise@4.0.1/dist/simplex-noise.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404


okay baaaaiiii!!!
